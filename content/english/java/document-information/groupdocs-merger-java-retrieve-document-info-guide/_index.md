## Implementation Guide

### Retrieve Document Information

#### Overview

Using GroupDocs.Merger, access metadata such as page counts and authors, enhancing document management applications.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Step 1: Initialize the Merger**

Create a new `Merger` instance with your document's path:

```java
import com.groupdocs.merger.Merger;
import com.groupdocs.merger.domain.result.IDocumentInfo;

// Initialize the Merger with a sample VSDX file path
Merger merger = new Merger("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.vsdx");
```

**Step 2: Retrieve Document Information**

Obtain document details using `getDocumentInfo`:

```java
// Get document information
IDocumentInfo info = merger.getDocumentInfo();
```

This code retrieves an instance of `IDocumentInfo`, containing various document properties.

**Step 3: Access Document Attributes**

Access specific attributes like page count:

```java
// Print page count
System.out.println("Pages Count: " + info.getPageCount());
```

This integration allows you to use metadata in your application's logic or UI.

### Troubleshooting Tips
