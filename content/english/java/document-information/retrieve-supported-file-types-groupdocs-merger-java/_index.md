# How to Retrieve Supported File Types Using GroupDocs.Merger for Java

## Introduction

Working with multiple document formats in Java applications can be challenging, especially when you need to merge, split, or manage documents. Knowing which file types are supported by your tools is crucial for seamless integration. The GroupDocs.Merger library simplifies this process by providing a straightforward way to retrieve all supported file types. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to implement "Retrieve Supported File Types with GroupDocs.Merger for Java," ensuring that your application can handle various document formats effortlessly.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up the GroupDocs.Merger library in a Java project
- Retrieving and displaying supported file types using the library
- Best practices for integrating this functionality into real-world applications

Let's start by reviewing the prerequisites before we dive into implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher is recommended.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Any IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse will work.
- **GroupDocs.Merger Library:** Include this library in your project dependencies.

Familiarity with basic Java programming concepts and experience working with libraries in a Maven or Gradle environment are also beneficial. If you're new to these tools, consider reviewing their documentation first.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Merger for Java

To use GroupDocs.Merger for Java, set up the library in your project using Maven, Gradle, or by downloading directly from the official site.

### Maven Installation

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-merger</artifactId>
    <version>latest-version</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle Installation

Include this line in your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-merger:latest-version'
```

### Direct Download

Alternatively, download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Merger for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/java/).

#### License Acquisition Steps
1. **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to explore the library's features.
2. **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license if you need extended access without limitations.
3. **Purchase:** Consider purchasing a full license for long-term use.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

To initialize GroupDocs.Merger in your Java application, import the necessary classes:

```java
import com.groupdocs.merger.domain.FileType;
```

Now, let's move on to implementing the feature that retrieves supported file types.

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll guide you through retrieving supported file types using GroupDocs.Merger for Java.

### Overview

The primary goal is to obtain a list of all file types supported by GroupDocs.Merger and display their extensions. This feature helps ensure that your application can handle various document formats seamlessly.

#### Step 1: Obtain Supported File Types

First, retrieve the list of supported file types from the `FileType` class:

```java
List<FileType> fileTypes = FileType.getSupportedFileTypes();
```

This method returns a list containing all the file types that GroupDocs.Merger supports.

#### Step 2: Display File Extensions

Next, iterate through each `FileType` object and print its extension:

```java
for (FileType fileType : fileTypes) {
    System.out.println(fileType.getExtension());
}
```

This loop goes through each supported file type and outputs its extension to the console.

#### Step 3: Confirmation Message

Finally, output a confirmation message indicating successful retrieval:

```java
System.out.println("Supported file types retrieved successfully.");
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Dependency Issues:** Ensure that your Maven or Gradle dependencies are correctly configured.
- **Library Version:** Use the latest version of GroupDocs.Merger to access all features and bug fixes.

## Practical Applications

Understanding supported file types is essential for various applications:
1. **Document Management Systems:** Automatically categorize documents based on their type.
2. **File Conversion Tools:** Ensure compatibility before converting files between formats.
3. **Merging Applications:** Validate input files before merging to prevent errors.

Integration with other systems, such as cloud storage or document processing services, can further enhance functionality.

## Performance Considerations

When working with GroupDocs.Merger in Java, consider the following performance tips:
- **Optimize Memory Usage:** Ensure efficient memory management by disposing of objects when no longer needed.
- **Batch Processing:** Process files in batches to reduce resource consumption.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous methods for non-blocking operations.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to retrieve supported file types using GroupDocs.Merger for Java. By integrating this functionality into your applications, you can handle a wide range of document formats with ease. For further exploration, consider diving deeper into other features offered by GroupDocs.Merger, such as merging and splitting documents.
