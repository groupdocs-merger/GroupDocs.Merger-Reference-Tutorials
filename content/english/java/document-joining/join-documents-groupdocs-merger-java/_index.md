## Implementation Guide
### Initialize Merger with a PDF Document
**Overview:** Prepare your PDF document for joining operations using the `Merger` class. This step is crucial for setting up the initial document from which other files will be merged.

- **Step 1: Define the Source Path**
  ```java
  String pdfFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PDF"; // Replace with your actual PDF file path
  ```

- **Step 2: Initialize Merger**
  ```java
  Merger mergerPdf = new Merger(pdfFilePath);
  ```

### Join a DOCX Document
**Overview:** Add a Word document to the existing PDF document initialized in the previous section.

- **Step 1: Define the Source Path**
  ```java
  String docxFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX"; // Replace with your actual DOCX file path
  ```

- **Step 2: Join the Document**
  ```java
  mergerPdf.join(docxFilePath);
  ```

### Join an XLSX Document
**Overview:** Extend your merged document by adding an Excel spreadsheet.

- **Step 1: Define the Source Path**
  ```java
  String xlsxFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_XLSX"; // Replace with your actual XLSX file path
  ```

- **Step 2: Join the Document**
  ```java
  mergerPdf.join(xlsxFilePath);
  ```

### Join a PPTX Document
**Overview:** Include PowerPoint presentations to create comprehensive merged documents.

- **Step 1: Define the Source Path**
  ```java
  String pptxFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PPTX"; // Replace with your actual PPTX file path
  ```

- **Step 2: Join the Document**
  ```java
  mergerPdf.join(pptxFilePath);
  ```

### Save Merged Document
**Overview:** After joining all necessary documents, save the final merged output to a specified location.

- **Step 1: Define Output Path**
  ```java
  String outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/CrossJoinMultipleDocuments-" + Paths.get(pdfFilePath).getFileName().toString();
  File outputFile = new File(outputPath);
  ```

- **Step 2: Save the Document**
  ```java
  mergerPdf.save(outputFile.getPath());
  ```
