    <artifactId>groupdocs-merger</artifactId>
    <version>latest-version</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**

```

**Direct Download:**  
You can also download the latest version directly from [GroupDocs.Merger for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/java/).

### License Acquisition Steps

To get started with GroupDocs.Merger, you have a few options:
- **Free Trial**: Test the library's capabilities with limited functionality.
- **Temporary License**: Access full features for a short period by applying on their site.
- **Purchase**: For long-term projects, consider purchasing a license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once installed, initializing GroupDocs.Merger is straightforward. Import the necessary classes and set up your document paths:

```java
import com.groupdocs.merger.Merger;
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we will walk through merging three Word documents into one using GroupDocs.Merger.

### Overview of Document Merging Feature

The GroupDocs.Merger for Java allows seamless integration and joining of multiple documents. Here's how you can leverage its functionality to merge documents effectively.

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Documents

Ensure your Word files are ready and specify their paths in the code:

```java
String document1 = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX_2";
String document2 = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX_3";
String document3 = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX_4";
```

#### Step 2: Initialize the Merger

Create a `Merger` object with your first document to start the merging process:

```java
Merger merger = new Merger(document1);
```

**Why?**: Initializing with the first document sets it as the base for subsequent joins.

#### Step 3: Join Additional Documents

Use the `join()` method to add other documents:

```java
merger.join(document2);
merger.join(document3);
```

**Explanation:** Each call to `join()` appends the specified document to the existing merged file.

#### Step 4: Save the Merged Document

Finally, save your combined document with a unique path:

```java
String outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
File outputFile = new File(outputDirectory, "JoinMultipleDocuments-" + Paths.get(document1).getFileName().toString());
merger.save(outputFile.getPath());
```

**Why?**: This step finalizes and stores the merged file at your specified location.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Common Issue:** Missing dependencies. Ensure all required libraries are included in your project setup.
- **Solution:** Double-check your Maven or Gradle configurations for any missing entries.

## Practical Applications

1. **Business Reports:** Consolidate quarterly reports into a single document for streamlined analysis and presentation.
2. **Academic Research:** Merge research papers, appendices, and references into one comprehensive file.
