- **Free Trial**: Test the features without limitations.
- **Temporary License**: Get extended access for evaluation.
- **Purchase**: Opt for a full commercial license for production use.

## Implementation Guide
We'll explore how to implement key features of GroupDocs.Merger through distinct steps. Let’s break it down by functionality:

### Load Source Document
#### Overview
Loading the source document is the first step in any merging process. This feature initializes your work with GroupDocs.Merger.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Define Your Document Path**
   Start by specifying where your source document resides:
   ```java
   String documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_OTP";
   ```
2. **Initialize the Merger Object**
   Create an instance of `Merger` with the path to your document:
   ```java
   import com.groupdocs.merger.Merger;

   public class LoadSourceDocument {
       public static void run() throws Exception {
           // Initialize the Merger object
           Merger merger = new Merger(documentPath);
       }
   }
   ```

### Add Document for Merging
#### Overview
Once your source document is loaded, you can add other documents to be merged.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Set Paths for Documents**
   Define paths for both the primary and secondary documents:
   ```java
   String primaryDocumentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_OTP";
   String secondaryDocumentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_OTP_2";
   ```
2. **Create a Merger Object**
   Initialize `Merger` with the primary document:
   ```java
   Merger merger = new Merger(primaryDocumentPath);
   ```
3. **Add Another Document**
   Use the `join` method to add documents for merging:
   ```java
   public class AddDocumentForMerging {
       public static void run() throws Exception {
           // Add another document
           merger.join(secondaryDocumentPath);
       }
   }
   ```

### Save Merged Document
#### Overview
After adding all necessary documents, save the merged output to a specified location.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Define Output Path**
   Specify where you want your merged document saved:
   ```java
   String outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/merged.otp";
   ```
2. **Save the Merged Document**
   Use the `save` method to write the final file:
   ```java
   import java.io.File;

   public class SaveMergedDocument {
       public static void run() throws Exception {
           // Assume documents have been joined
           merger.save(outputPath);
       }
   }
   ```

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Merger for Java can be used in various real-world scenarios:
1. **Merging Financial Reports**: Combine quarterly and annual reports into a single document.
2. **Consolidating Research Papers**: Integrate multiple sections of a research paper before submission.
3. **Automated Document Processing Systems**: Streamline workflows by automatically merging documents based on predefined rules.
