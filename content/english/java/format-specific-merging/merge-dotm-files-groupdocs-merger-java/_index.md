## Implementation Guide

Explore how to merge DOTM files using the features of GroupDocs.Merger for Java:

### Load Source DOTM File
#### Overview
This step involves loading a source DOTM file, setting the stage for merging operations using GroupDocs.Merger.
#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Define the Path to the Source File**
Specify the directory of your DOTM file.
```java
String sourceFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.dotm";
```
**2. Create a Merger Object**
Initialize a `Merger` object with the source file path.
```java
import com.groupdocs.merger.Merger;

public class LoadSourceDotm {
    public static void run() throws Exception {
        Merger merger = new Merger(sourceFilePath);
        // The Merger object is now ready for further operations such as joining other documents.
    }
}
```
### Add Another DOTM File to Merge
#### Overview
Once you have your source file loaded, the next step involves adding additional DOTM files.
#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Define Additional File Path**
Specify paths for both the source and additional DOTM files.
```java
String additionalFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample_dotm_2.dotm";
```
**2. Add Files to Merger**
Use the `join` method to add another file for merging.
```java
import com.groupdocs.merger.Merger;

public class AddDotmFileToMerge {
    public static void run() throws Exception {
        Merger merger = new Merger(sourceFilePath);
        merger.join(additionalFilePath);
        // The files are now prepared for merging.
    }
}
```
### Merge DOTM Files and Save Result
#### Overview
The final step involves merging the files and saving the result.
#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Define Output File Path**
Set the path where the merged document will be saved.
```java
String outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
String outputFile = outputFolder + "/merged.dotm";
```
**2. Merge Files and Save**
Invoke `save` to store the combined document at the specified location.
```java
import com.groupdocs.merger.Merger;

public class MergeDotmFiles {
    public static void run() throws Exception {
        Merger merger = new Merger(sourceFilePath);
        merger.join(additionalFilePath);
        merger.save(outputFile);
    }
}
```
