```

## Implementation Guide

### Load and Merge MHTML Files

This section guides you through loading multiple MHTML files and merging them into a single document.

#### Overview

Combining MHTML files streamlines the process of handling web-based content, making it easier to share or archive. With GroupDocs.Merger, this task becomes effortless.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**1. Define Output Directory**

Specify where you want your merged file saved:
```java
String outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

**2. Initialize Merger with the First MHTML File**

Load the initial source file to begin merging:
```java
Merger merger = new Merger("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_MHTML");
```

*Explanation:* Here, `Merger` is initialized with the path of your first MHTML document.

**3. Add Additional MHTML Files**

Add more files using the `join` method:
```java
merger.join("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_MHTML_2");
```

*Explanation:* This step appends another MHTML file to the merger instance, preparing it for a unified output.

**4. Save the Merged Result**

Finally, save your merged document:
```java
String outputFile = new File(outputFolder, "merged.mhtml").getPath();
merger.save(outputFile);
```

*Explanation:* The `save` method consolidates all added files into one specified by `outputFile`.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Files:** Ensure all MHTML file paths are correct and accessible.
- **Memory Issues:** Close unused resources and consider splitting large documents if needed.
