    <artifactId>groupdocs-merger</artifactId>
    <version>latest-version</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
Include this in your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-merger:latest-version'
```

### Direct Download
Alternatively, download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Merger for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/java/).

#### License Acquisition Steps
To use GroupDocs.Merger, acquire a license through:

Once the library is added, initialize it as follows:
```java
import com.groupdocs.merger.Merger;

class OneNoteMerger {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Merger merger = new Merger("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_ONE");
        // Further implementation will go here...
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Merging Multiple OneNote Files
This feature consolidates several `.one` files into a single document, making note management easier.

#### Step 1: Load the Source OneNote File
Begin by loading the first OneNote file:
```java
Merger merger = new Merger("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_ONE");
```
- **Parameters:** Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_ONE"` with your initial `.one` file path.
- **Purpose:** Initializes the `Merger` object for merging operations.

#### Step 2: Add Another OneNote File
Use the `join()` method to append additional files:
```java
merger.join("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_ONE_2");
```
- **Parameters:** Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_ONE_2"` with another `.one` file path.
- **Purpose:** Merges this file into the current document managed by `Merger`.

#### Step 3: Save the Merged Result
Save your merged OneNote file:
```java
String outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
String outputFile = new File(outputFolder, "merged.one").getPath();
merger.save(outputFile);
```
- **Parameters:** Set `outputFolder` to your desired location.
- **Purpose:** Saves the combined document as `"merged.one"` in the specified directory.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all file paths are correct and accessible.
- Check for compatibility issues between different OneNote versions.

## Practical Applications

Merging OneNote files is beneficial in scenarios like:
1. **Project Management:** Consolidate team notes into a single document for streamlined tracking.
2. **Academic Research:** Combine research notes from various sessions or sources.
3. **Business Meetings:** Merge meeting minutes and action items into one comprehensive file.

## Performance Considerations

When merging large OneNote files, consider:
- Monitoring memory usage to prevent excessive resource consumption.
- Optimizing Java environment by adjusting heap size if necessary.
- Utilizing GroupDocs.Mergerâ€™s efficient algorithms for minimal performance impact.

## Conclusion

Following this tutorial enables you to merge multiple Microsoft OneNote files using GroupDocs.Merger for Java, enhancing note management efficiency.

**Next Steps:**
- Experiment with merging different document types supported by GroupDocs.
- Explore additional features like splitting or securing merged documents.
