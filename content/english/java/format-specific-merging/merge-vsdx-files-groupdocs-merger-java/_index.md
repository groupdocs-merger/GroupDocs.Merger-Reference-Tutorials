Ready to transform the way you handle Visio documents? Let's dive into the prerequisites first.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following in place:
- **Required Libraries**: You'll need GroupDocs.Merger for Java. Make sure your project includes this library.
  
- **Environment Setup**: A working Java development environment (IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) is necessary. Ensure JDK 8 or higher is installed.

- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of Java programming and familiarity with dependency management tools such as Maven or Gradle will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Merger for Java

To integrate GroupDocs.Merger into your project, you can use either Maven or Gradle. Here’s how to do it:

### Using Maven
Add the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-merger</artifactId>
    <version>latest-version</version>
</dependency>
```

### Using Gradle
Include this line in your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-merger:latest-version'
```

### Direct Download
Alternatively, download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Merger for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/java/).

#### License Acquisition Steps
You can start with a free trial to evaluate GroupDocs.Merger. For extended usage, consider purchasing a license or obtaining a temporary one:
- **Free Trial**: Access basic functionalities to test the tool.
- **Temporary License**: Available for short-term use without limitations.
- **Purchase**: Obtain a permanent license if you find it fits your needs.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
To initialize GroupDocs.Merger, simply import the library into your Java project and create an instance of `Merger`.

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's break down the merging process into manageable steps using specific features provided by GroupDocs.Merger for Java.

### Load a Source VSDX File
**Overview**: Start by loading the initial Visio file that you want to use as your base document in the merge operation.

#### Step 1: Import Required Classes
```java
import com.groupdocs.merger.Merger;
```

#### Step 2: Define and Load Document Path
Specify the path of your source VSDX file:
```java
String documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_VSDX";
Merger merger = new Merger(documentPath);
```
Ensure `documentPath` points to a valid .vsdx file. This step initializes the merge process with your primary document.

### Add Another VSDX File for Merging
**Overview**: Enhance your initial document by adding another Visio file into the merging operation.

#### Step 1: Define Additional Document Path
Set the path to the additional file you wish to merge:
```java
String additionalDocumentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_VSDX_2";
```

#### Step 2: Merge Files Using `join()`
Use the `join` method to combine your documents:
```java
Merger merger = new Merger(documentPath); // Reuse 'documentPath' from earlier.
merger.join(additionalDocumentPath);
```
The `join` function takes another file path as input and appends it to the original document.

### Save the Merged VSDX File
**Overview**: Once your files are merged, save the result into a single output Visio file.

#### Step 1: Define Output Path
Set up where you want to store the final merged document:
```java
String outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
String outputFile = new File(outputFolder, "merged.vsdx").getPath();
```

#### Step 2: Save Merged Document
Invoke the `save` method to write your merged file:
```java
Merger merger = new Merger(documentPath);
merger.join(additionalDocumentPath); // Ensure both files are added.
merger.save(outputFile);
```
The merged document will now be saved at the specified location.
