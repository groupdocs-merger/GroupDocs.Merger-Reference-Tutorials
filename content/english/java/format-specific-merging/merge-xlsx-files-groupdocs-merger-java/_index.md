## Implementation Guide

### Merging Multiple XLSX Files

Let's break down the merging process:

String outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
String outputFile = new File(outputFolder, "merged.xlsx").getPath();
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Merger with Source File
Load your primary XLSX document:
```java
Merger merger = new Merger("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_XLSX");
```

#### Step 3: Add Additional Files to Merge
Join additional files into the main document:
```java
merger.join("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_XLSX_2");
```

#### Step 4: Save the Merged File
Save your merged file at the specified location:
```java
merger.save(outputFile);
```

### Parameters and Method Purposes
