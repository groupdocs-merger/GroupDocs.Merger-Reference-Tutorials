With these prerequisites in place, you're ready to set up GroupDocs.Merger for Java.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Merger for Java

To get started with merging XPS files using GroupDocs.Merger, follow these installation steps:

### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>groupdocs-merger</artifactId>
    <version>latest-version</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
```gradle
implementation 'com.groupdocs:groupdocs-merger:latest-version'
```

### Direct Download
For those preferring manual setups, download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Merger for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/java/).

#### License Acquisition Steps
1. **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to explore basic functionalities.
2. **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for full feature access during evaluation.
3. **Purchase:** For ongoing use, purchase a license on [GroupDocs Purchase](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

#### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once you have the library set up, initialize your project with GroupDocs.Merger using the following code snippet:

```java
import com.groupdocs.merger.Merger;

public class MergeXPSFiles {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Merger merger = new Merger("path/to/your/document.xps");
        // This initializes a Merger object with your source XPS file.
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Load and Merge XPS Files

#### Overview
This feature lets you load multiple XPS files into the GroupDocs.Merger environment, preparing them for merging.

##### Initialize the Merger Object
Create an instance of the `Merger` class to start loading documents.
```java
import com.groupdocs.merger.Merger;

// Load the initial XPS file for merging
Merger merger = new Merger("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_XPS");
```
*Explanation*: The `Merger` constructor initializes with a source document path.

##### Add Another XPS File to Merge
To add additional files, use the `join` method.
```java
// Add another file to merge
merger.join("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_XPS_2");
```
*Explanation*: This step appends the specified XPS file for merging with the initial document.

#### Save Merged Output File

After loading and adding files, save your merged document:
```java
String outputFile = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/merged.xps";
merger.save(outputFile);
// This saves the combined output to the defined path.
```
*Explanation*: The `save` method writes the merged file to your desired location.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Invalid File Path**: Ensure paths are correct and accessible.
- **Insufficient Permissions**: Verify that you have read/write permissions for specified directories.
- **Memory Management**: Use efficient data structures if handling large files to prevent memory overflow.

## Practical Applications

Merging XPS files can be beneficial in various scenarios:

1. **Document Consolidation**: Combine multiple chapters of a book into one document for easier distribution.
2. **Archiving**: Merge historical records or logs into single documents for archival purposes.
3. **Collaborative Workflows**: Integrate contributions from different team members efficiently.

## Performance Considerations

Optimizing performance when using GroupDocs.Merger is crucial:

- **Efficient Memory Use**: Ensure sufficient memory allocation, especially with large files.
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple documents in batches to minimize overhead.
- **Best Practices**: Regularly update your library and JVM for optimal compatibility.
