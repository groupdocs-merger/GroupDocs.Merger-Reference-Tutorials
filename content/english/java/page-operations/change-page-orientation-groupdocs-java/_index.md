    <artifactId>groupdocs-merger</artifactId>
    <version>latest-version</version>
</dependency>
```

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once you have the library ready in your project, import it as follows:
```java
import com.groupdocs.merger.Merger;
import com.groupdocs.merger.domain.options.OrientationMode;
import com.groupdocs.merger.domain.options.OrientationOptions;
```

## Implementation Guide

### Change Page Orientation

This feature lets you adjust the orientation of specific pages in a document, providing flexibility without reformatting your entire file.

#### Step 1: Set Paths for Your Document

Define paths for both the source and output documents. Customize these according to your directory structure:
```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX";
String filePathOut = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ChangePageOrientation-" + 
    Paths.get(filePath).getFileName().toString();
```

#### Step 2: Create OrientationOptions

Specify which pages need orientation changes and the desired mode (Landscape or Portrait).
```java
// Change page orientation for pages 3 and 4 to Landscape.
OrientationOptions orientationOptions = new OrientationOptions(OrientationMode.Landscape, 
    new int[] { 3, 4 });
```

#### Step 3: Initialize Merger

Prepare your document for modification by initializing the `Merger` object.
```java
Merger merger = new Merger(filePath);
```

#### Step 4: Apply Changes and Save

Use the `changeOrientation` method to apply your settings and save the modified document:
```java
// Apply orientation changes as per the specified options.
merger.changeOrientation(orientationOptions);

// Save the updated document.
merger.save(filePathOut);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Not Found:** Double-check your file paths for typos or incorrect directory structures.
- **Library Dependency Issues:** Ensure that you've included GroupDocs Merger correctly in your project's dependencies.

## Practical Applications

1. **Educational Materials:** Adjust orientation for large diagrams on specific pages while keeping text sections intact.
2. **Business Reports:** Use landscape mode for wide tables without altering the entire document format.
3. **Photography Portfolios:** Showcase images on single pages with different orientations within a portfolio document.

## Performance Considerations

- **Resource Usage:** Keep an eye on memory usage, especially when processing large documents.
- **Optimization Tips:** Close `Merger` instances promptly to free resources.
- **Best Practices:** Handle exceptions gracefully and ensure that your application manages Java garbage collection efficiently.
