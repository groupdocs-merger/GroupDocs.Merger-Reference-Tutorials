import com.groupdocs.merger.Merger;

Merger merger = new Merger("path/to/your/file.txt");
```

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Merger for Java

This section guides you through setting up GroupDocs.Merger in your Java project.

### Installation Information

**Maven and Gradle**: Include the dependency as shown above.

**Direct Download**: Alternatively, download from [GroupDocs.Merger for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/java/) and add it to your library path.

### License Acquisition Steps

1. **Free Trial**: Access a free trial via their release page.
2. **Temporary License**: Acquire a temporary license if needed beyond the trial period.
3. **Purchase**: Buy a full license for commercial use from [GroupDocs' purchase site](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization and Setup

To start using GroupDocs.Merger, initialize it as follows:

```java
import com.groupdocs.merger.Merger;

Merger merger = new Merger("path/to/your/file.txt");
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's implement the core functionality of splitting a text file by lines.

### Split Text File into Separate Line Documents

This feature allows you to convert each line in your text file into an individual document. Here's how with GroupDocs.Merger for Java.

#### Step 1: Import Necessary Packages

Start by importing required packages:

```java
import com.groupdocs.merger.Merger;
import com.groupdocs.merger.domain.options.TextSplitOptions;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
```

#### Step 2: Define File Paths

Set input and output paths, replacing placeholders with actual paths:

```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.txt";
String filePathOut = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";
```

#### Step 3: Load the Input Text File

Create a `Merger` instance to load the text file you intend to split.

```java
Merger merger = new Merger(filePath);
```

#### Step 4: Define Split Options

Configure splitting options using `TextSplitOptions`. This defines how each line should be processed into separate files:

```java
// Create TextSplitOptions instance specifying mode to split by lines.
TextSplitOptions splitOptions = new TextSplitOptions(filePathOut, true, true);
```

#### Step 5: Perform the Split Operation

Use `split` method from the Merger object to perform the operation:

```java
merger.split(splitOptions);
```
**Parameters Explained**: 
- The first parameter is the output directory for files.
- The second and third parameters control overwriting behavior and file extension handling.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Path Errors**: Verify your input/output paths for errors.
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure application permissions to read/write in specified directories.
- **Library Version Conflicts**: Check that GroupDocs.Merger version matches other dependencies.

## Practical Applications

Splitting text files into line-based documents can be useful in:
1. **Data Processing Pipelines**: Break down large datasets for parallel or distributed tasks.
2. **Log File Management**: Separate each log entry into its own file for easier auditing.
3. **Content Segmentation**: Convert article drafts line-by-line to facilitate collaborative editing.

## Performance Considerations

When using GroupDocs.Merger in Java:
- **Memory Optimization**: Use efficient data structures and close resources promptly.
- **Batch Processing**: For large volumes, consider batching operations for better resource management.
- **Java Memory Management**: Monitor heap usage and adjust JVM options as necessary.

## Conclusion

You've learned how to split a text file into separate line documents using GroupDocs.Merger for Java. This functionality can enhance your data handling capabilities, allowing you to process large files efficiently.

### Next Steps:
- Experiment with additional GroupDocs.Merger features like merging and securing documents.
- Explore integration possibilities with other systems or frameworks in your projects.

**Call-to-action**: Try implementing this solution in your next Java project!
