## Implementation Guide

In this section, we guide you through merging PDF files with bookmarks using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET.

### Merging Multiple PDF Files with Bookmarks

#### Overview
Merging multiple PDFs while preserving their bookmarks helps maintain document structure. We’ll use **PdfJoinOptions** to ensure bookmarks are included in the merged output.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Define Directory Paths:**
   Set up paths for your source documents and the output directory:
   ```csharp
   string documentDirectory = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
   string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";
   ```
2. **Load Source PDF File:**
   Initialize the `Merger` object with your primary PDF file:
   ```csharp
   using (var merger = new Merger(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "SAMPLE_PDF.pdf")))
   {
       // Code to merge additional files will be here.
   }
   ```
3. **Initialize PdfJoinOptions:**
   Configure options for merging with bookmarks enabled:
   ```csharp
   var pdfJoinOptions = new PdfJoinOptions { UseBookmarks = true };
   ```
4. **Merge PDF Files:**
   Add additional PDFs to merge, ensuring bookmarks are preserved:
   ```csharp
   merger.Join(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "SAMPLE_PDF_BOOKMARKS.pdf"), pdfJoinOptions);
   ```
5. **Save Merged PDF:**
   Save the combined document in your specified output directory:
   ```csharp
   string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "merged.pdf");
   merger.Save(outputFile);
   ```
#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing Bookmarks**: Ensure `UseBookmarks` is set to true.
- **Path Errors**: Verify the correctness of all file paths.

## Practical Applications
Merging PDFs with bookmarks has numerous practical applications:
1. **Consolidating Reports**: Combine quarterly reports while retaining individual section bookmarks for quick access.
2. **Course Material Compilation**: Merge lecture notes and references into a single, bookmarked document for students.
3. **Project Documentation**: Assemble comprehensive project documentation from multiple sources with easy navigation.

## Performance Considerations
When working with large PDF files or numerous documents:
- Optimize memory usage by processing one file at a time if possible.
- Ensure your environment has sufficient resources to handle the merge process efficiently.
- Follow best practices for .NET memory management to prevent leaks and enhance performance.
