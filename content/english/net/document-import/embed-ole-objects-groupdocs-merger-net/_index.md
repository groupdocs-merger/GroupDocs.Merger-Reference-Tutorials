{
    // Your code to work with the document
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Embedding OLE Objects in Spreadsheets
This section details how you can embed an OLE object, like a PDF file, into your spreadsheet using **GroupDocs.Merger for .NET**.

#### Overview of Feature
Embedding OLE objects allows you to insert entire documents as interactive elements within your Excel sheets. This is particularly useful when presenting data alongside related reports or documents.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
##### 1. Set Paths and Page Number
Define the paths for your source spreadsheet, the embedded file (e.g., a PDF), and specify where in the document you want to embed it.

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_XLSX";
string embeddedFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PDF";
int pageNumber = 2; // The specific page to embed

// Output path for the modified spreadsheet
string filePathOut = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "OUT_SAMPLE_NAME.xlsx");
```
##### 2. Configure OleSpreadsheetOptions
Create an instance of `OleSpreadsheetOptions` with necessary configurations, specifying where in the sheet you want the OLE object to be placed.

```csharp
// Specify row and column indices for embedding
OleSpreadsheetOptions oleCellsOptions = new OleSpreadsheetOptions(embeddedFilePath, pageNumber)
{
    RowIndex = 2,
    ColumnIndex = 2
};
```
##### 3. Initialize Merger and Perform Embedding
Use the `Merger` class to import the document as an OLE object.

```csharp
using (Merger merger = new Merger(filePath))
{
    merger.ImportDocument(oleCellsOptions); // Import the specified document as an OLE object into the spreadsheet
    merger.Save(filePathOut); // Save the modified document
}
```
#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correct and accessible.
- Verify that the page number for embedding is valid within the source document.

## Practical Applications
Embedding OLE objects can be used in various scenarios, such as:
1. **Financial Reports**: Embed detailed PDF financial statements directly into spreadsheets for easy access during analysis.
2. **Project Documentation**: Include project plans or technical specifications within a master spreadsheet for comprehensive tracking.
3. **Training Materials**: Link training manuals or guides within employee performance sheets.

## Performance Considerations
When embedding OLE objects, consider the following tips to optimize your application's performance:
- Minimize the size of embedded documents to reduce file load times.
- Ensure efficient memory management by disposing of objects properly after use.

Adhering to these best practices will help maintain a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you learned how to enhance spreadsheets using **GroupDocs.Merger for .NET** by embedding OLE objects. By following the steps outlined, you can efficiently integrate rich content into your Excel files, improving data presentation and accessibility.
