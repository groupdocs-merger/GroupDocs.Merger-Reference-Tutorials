using System.IO;
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll embed a PDF as an OLE object into a PowerPoint presentation.

### Importing a PDF as an OLE Object into Presentation

#### Overview
Embed a PDF file directly within a specific slide of your PowerPoint presentation. This is useful for referencing documents without altering them.

#### Code Implementation Steps:
**1. Define File Paths and Output Directory:**
```csharp
string filePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.pptx"); // Presentation file path
string embeddedFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.pdf"); // PDF to embed as OLE object
string outputDirectoryPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Output directory for modified presentation
string filePathOut = Path.Combine(outputDirectoryPath, "ModifiedPresentation.pptx"); // Output file path
```
**2. Specify Page and Position:**
```csharp
int pageNumber = 2; // Slide number to add OLE object
OlePresentationOptions oleSlidesOptions = new OlePresentationOptions(embeddedFilePath, pageNumber)
{
    X = 10, // X-coordinate for positioning the embedded object on the slide
    Y = 10  // Y-coordinate for positioning the embedded object on the slide
};
```
**3. Initialize Merger and Import Document:**
```csharp
using (Merger merger = new Merger(filePath)) // Initialize with presentation file path
{
    merger.ImportDocument(oleSlidesOptions); // Embed PDF as OLE using specified options
    merger.Save(filePathOut); // Save the modified presentation to output directory
}
```
#### Explanation:
- **OlePresentationOptions**: Specifies the embedded file, its position (X and Y coordinates), and the slide number.
- **ImportDocument Method**: Embeds the OLE object into the presentation using provided options.

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Verify paths for both files are correct and accessible.
- Ensure GroupDocs.Merger library is correctly installed and referenced.
- Check write permissions to the output directory.

## Practical Applications
Embedding a PDF as an OLE object can be beneficial in several scenarios:
1. **Corporate Presentations**: Reference financial reports or contracts during meetings without altering originals.
2. **Educational Materials**: Teachers embed supplementary materials into lecture slides.
3. **Project Management**: Project managers include project plans in status updates.
4. **Sales Pitches**: Sales teams incorporate product specs within presentations.
5. **Technical Documentation**: Engineers reference schematics or blueprints in briefings.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance with GroupDocs.Merger for .NET:
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Keep only necessary files in memory to prevent excessive resource consumption.
- **Efficient File Handling**: Manage file streams efficiently and close them promptly after use.
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple presentations in batches to minimize system load.
