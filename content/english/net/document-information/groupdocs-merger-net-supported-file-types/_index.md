This comprehensive guide addresses a common challenge—identifying all supported file formats using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. By leveraging this robust library, you can ensure your application handles various documents effortlessly.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to retrieve supported file types with GroupDocs.Merger for .NET.
- The process of displaying these file types in an organized manner.
- Best practices for integrating this functionality into your .NET applications.

Before we delve deeper, let's review the prerequisites for using GroupDocs.Merger.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, ensure you have:
- **Required Libraries:** The GroupDocs.Merger library. Confirm compatibility with your .NET framework version.
- **Environment Setup:** A development environment like Visual Studio or any IDE that supports .NET applications is necessary.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** Familiarity with C# and basic collection handling in .NET will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Merger for .NET

Getting started with GroupDocs.Merger for .NET is straightforward. Follow these installation steps:

### Installation Methods

**.NET CLI**
```
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Merger
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Merger
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:** 
Search for "GroupDocs.Merger" and install the latest version through the NuGet interface.

### License Acquisition

To unlock full capabilities, start with a free trial or request a temporary license. For production use, consider purchasing a full license for uninterrupted access and support.

**Basic Initialization:**
After installation, initialize GroupDocs.Merger as follows:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Merger.Domain;

// Your initialization code here
```

## Implementation Guide

With your environment set up, let's focus on retrieving and displaying supported file types using GroupDocs.Merger.

### Feature: Get Supported File Types

This feature allows fetching a list of all file formats the library supports. Here’s how to implement it:

#### Step 1: Retrieve Supported File Types
Start by obtaining a collection of supported file types, ordered by their extensions:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using GroupDocs.Merger.Domain;

// Obtain and order the list of supported file types\IEnumerable<FileType> fileTypes = FileType.GetSupportedFileTypes().OrderBy(fileType => fileType.Extension);
```

#### Step 2: Display File Type Information
Iterate over each `FileType` object to display its details:
```csharp
foreach (FileType fileType in fileTypes)
{
    // Output the information about each file type
    Console.WriteLine(fileType); 
}
```
**Explanation:** Here, we use LINQ to order file types by their extensions, making it easier to manage and present them logically.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Issue:** No file types are listed.
  - **Solution:** Ensure you have the latest version of GroupDocs.Merger installed. Check for updates in NuGet or on the official website.

## Practical Applications

Understanding supported file formats has several practical applications:
1. **Document Conversion Tools:** Automatically detect and convert documents into user-preferred formats.
2. **File Upload Validation:** Validate file types before allowing uploads to enhance security.
3. **Data Migration Projects:** Ensure seamless migration of documents across systems by knowing which formats are supported.

## Performance Considerations

Efficient handling of file type data is essential for optimal performance:
- **Optimize Iteration:** Use LINQ efficiently to minimize overhead when processing large lists.
- **Memory Management:** Dispose of unused objects promptly to manage memory effectively in .NET applications.

## Conclusion

By integrating GroupDocs.Merger into your .NET projects, you've unlocked a powerful toolset for handling diverse document formats. This guide has equipped you with the knowledge to retrieve and display supported file types efficiently.
