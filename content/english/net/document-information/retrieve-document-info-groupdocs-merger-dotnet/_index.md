### Installation via CLI

Using the .NET Core Command Line Interface (CLI), add the package by running:

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Merger
```

### Using Package Manager Console

Alternatively, in Visual Studio's Package Manager Console, execute:

```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Merger
```

### NuGet Package Manager UI

For a graphical interface, navigate to the **NuGet Package Manager** in Visual Studio. Search for "GroupDocs.Merger" and install the latest version.

#### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: Download a free trial from [GroupDocs' release page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/net/) to test the library's capabilities.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for more extensive testing [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase**: If GroupDocs.Merger meets your needs, purchase a full license [directly from GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

#### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once installed, include the necessary namespaces in your project:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Merger;
using GroupDocs.Merger.Domain.Result;
```

## Implementation Guide

Now that you have everything set up, let's dive into retrieving document information.

### Retrieve Document Information

#### Overview
Retrieving metadata is a common requirement for many applications. With GroupDocs.Merger, you can easily extract and display details about any supported document format.

##### Step 1: Set Up the File Path
Specify the path to your input document:

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_VSDX";
```

This example uses a VSDX file, but GroupDocs.Merger supports many formats like DOCX, PDF, and more.

##### Step 2: Initialize Merger
Create an instance of the `Merger` class using your document's path. The `Merger` class handles various document operations:

```csharp
using (Merger merger = new Merger(filePath))
{
    // Retrieve information about the document in the next steps
}
```

##### Step 3: Retrieve Document Information
Use the `GetDocumentInfo()` method to fetch details about your document, returning an object containing metadata such as page count and author:

```csharp
IDocumentInfo info = merger.GetDocumentInfo();
```

##### Step 4: Display Document Information
Output the retrieved information to the console or integrate it into your application logic:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(info);
```

**Parameters & Return Values**: The `GetDocumentInfo()` method returns an `IDocumentInfo` object containing various metadata attributes. Handle this data appropriately based on your application's requirements.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Issues**: Double-check the file path and ensure the document exists.
- **Unsupported Formats**: Verify that GroupDocs.Merger supports the document format you are working with.
- **Exception Handling**: Use try-catch blocks to manage exceptions gracefully.

## Practical Applications
Retrieving document information is useful in various scenarios:
1. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Automatically extract and display metadata for uploaded documents.
2. **Document Review Platforms**: Display author details, page counts, etc., during the review process.
3. **Legal Software**: Analyze documents to extract case-related metadata.

Integration with other systems, like databases or cloud storage solutions, can enhance these applications by storing or processing document data efficiently.

## Performance Considerations
When working with GroupDocs.Merger in a .NET environment:
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Monitor memory usage and optimize where necessary for large-scale applications.
- **.NET Memory Management**: Dispose of objects appropriately using `using` statements to prevent memory leaks.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Use asynchronous methods to improve application responsiveness if possible.

## Conclusion
You've now learned how to retrieve document information efficiently with GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. This powerful library simplifies handling various document formats and extracting valuable metadata seamlessly.
