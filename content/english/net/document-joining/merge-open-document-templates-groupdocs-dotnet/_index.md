## Implementation Guide

### Load Source ODT File

Loading an Open Document Template file into the merger object is the first step before merging additional documents.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**
1. **Specify the File Path:**
   Define the path to your source ODT file.
   
   ```csharp
   string sourceOttFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\source.odt"; // Replace with your actual path
   ```

2. **Load the Source ODT File:**
   Use the `Merger` class to load the file.
   
   ```csharp
   using (var merger = new Merger(sourceOttFilePath))
   {
       // The source ODT file is now loaded for further operations.
   }
   ```

### Add Another ODT File to Merge

To merge additional ODT files, follow these steps:

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**
1. **Specify Additional File Path:**
   Set the path for the additional ODT file.
   
   ```csharp
   string additionalOttFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\additional.odt"; // Replace with your actual path
   ```

2. **Add the File to Merge:**
   Use the `Join` method to add the new document.
   
   ```csharp
   using (var merger = new Merger(sourceOttFilePath))
   {
       merger.Join(additionalOttFilePath); // Add an additional ODT file for merging.
   }
   ```

### Merge ODT Files and Save Result

Finally, save your merged documents as a single output file.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**
1. **Define Output Path:**
   Determine where to save the merged file.
   
   ```csharp
   string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Placeholder for the output directory path
   string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.odt");
   ```

2. **Save Merged Document:**
   Use the `Save` method to write the result.
   
   ```csharp
   using (var merger = new Merger(sourceOttFilePath))
   {
       merger.Join(additionalOttFilePath); // Add an additional ODT file for merging.
       merger.Save(outputFile); // Save the merged output as a single ODT file.
   }
   ```

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where merging ODT files can be beneficial:
1. **Project Documentation:** Combine multiple project templates into one comprehensive master document.
2. **Report Generation:** Merge various sections of reports for a unified presentation.
3. **Template Consolidation:** Create a single template from different departmental versions for uniformity.
