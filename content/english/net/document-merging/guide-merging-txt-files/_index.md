## Introduction
In the world of .NET development, manipulating and merging text files is a common requirement for various applications. GroupDocs.Merger for .NET offers a powerful solution for merging TXT files seamlessly within your .NET projects. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of merging TXT files step by step using GroupDocs.Merger.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into merging TXT files with GroupDocs.Merger for .NET, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
- Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio, a preferred IDE for .NET development.
- GroupDocs.Merger for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Merger for .NET from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/net/).
- Access to TXT Files: Prepare the TXT files that you want to merge.

## Import Namespaces
First, import the necessary namespaces in your .NET project to utilize GroupDocs.Merger functionalities:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```

Follow these steps to merge TXT files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET:
## Step 1: Set Output Directory
Define the output directory path where the merged TXT file will be saved.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Output Directory";
```
## Step 2: Define Output File Path
Combine the output directory path with the desired output file name.
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.txt");
```
## Step 3: Load Source TXT Files
Initialize the `Merger` object with the path of the source TXT file you want to merge.
```csharp
using (var merger = new Merger("Path_to_Source_TXT_File"))
{
    // Add another TXT file to merge
    merger.Join("Path_to_Another_TXT_File");
    
    // Merge TXT files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
## Step 4: Execute Merge Operation
Inside the `using` block, join additional TXT files using `merger.Join("Path_to_Another_TXT_File")` to combine multiple TXT files into one. Then, save the merged result using `merger.Save(outputFile)`.
## Step 5: Verify Merged Output
Confirm that the TXT files have been successfully merged by checking the specified output directory.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nTXT files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
