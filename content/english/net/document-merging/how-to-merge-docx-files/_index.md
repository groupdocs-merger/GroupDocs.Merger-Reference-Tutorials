# How to Merge DOCX Files

## Introduction
In the world of .NET development, merging DOCX files programmatically can be a powerful capability for various applications. GroupDocs.Merger for .NET provides a comprehensive solution for merging DOCX files efficiently. This tutorial will guide you through the process of using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET to merge multiple DOCX files into a single document seamlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

## Import Namespaces
Begin by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# project:

## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Name
First, define the output folder where the merged DOCX file will be saved and specify the output file name.

using (var merger = new Merger("Your Sample Document File"X))
{
    // Add another DOCX file to merge
    merger.Join("Your Sample Document File"X_2);
    
    // Merge DOCX files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
