## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to merge DOTX (Word Template) files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. GroupDocs.Merger is a powerful API that enables developers to manipulate various document formats seamlessly within .NET applications. By leveraging this API, you can efficiently merge multiple DOTX files into a single document with just a few lines of code.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following:
- Visual Studio installed on your machine
- .NET SDK (compatible version) installed
- GroupDocs.Merger for .NET installed (refer to the [installation guide](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/) for details)
- Basic knowledge of C# programming

## Import Namespaces
To get started, import the necessary namespaces into your C# project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Output Directory and File Name
First, define the output directory path and the name of the merged DOTX file.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YourOutputDirectory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.dotx");
```
Replace `"YourOutputDirectory"` with the path where you want to save the merged DOTX file.
## Step 2: Merge DOTX Files
Next, use GroupDocs.Merger to merge multiple DOTX files into a single document.
```csharp
// Load the source DOTX file
using (var merger = new GroupDocs.Merger.Merger(Constants.SAMPLE_DOTX))
{
    // Add another DOTX file to merge
    merger.Join(Constants.SAMPLE_DOTX_2);
    
    // Merge DOTX files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
Console.WriteLine("\nDOTX files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
In this code snippet:
- `Constants.SAMPLE_DOTX` and `Constants.SAMPLE_DOTX_2` represent paths to the DOTX files you want to merge. Replace these with your actual file paths.
- `merger.Join()` is used to add additional DOTX files to the merger.
- `merger.Save()` combines the DOTX files and saves the merged result to the specified `outputFile` path.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered how to merge DOTX files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. By following these steps and leveraging the power of GroupDocs.Merger, you can efficiently manipulate Word Template files within your .NET applications.
