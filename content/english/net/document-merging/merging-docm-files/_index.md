## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to merge DOCM (Microsoft Word Macro-Enabled Document) files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. This library provides powerful document manipulation features, allowing developers to merge, split, extract, and manipulate various document formats seamlessly within their .NET applications.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Development Environment: Visual Studio or any preferred .NET development environment.
- GroupDocs.Merger for .NET Library: Download the library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/net/) and include it in your project.
- Sample DOCM Files: Prepare the DOCM files that you want to merge.
  

## Import Namespaces
First, include the necessary namespaces to use GroupDocs.Merger in your C# project:
```csharp
using System; 
using GroupDocs.Merger;
using System.IO;
```

Let's break down the merging process into simple steps:
## Step 1: Set Output Directory
Define the output directory where the merged file will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Output Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.docm");
```
Replace `"Your Output Directory"` with the path where you want to save the merged DOCM file.
## Step 2: Load and Merge DOCM Files
Load the source DOCM files and merge them together using GroupDocs.Merger:
```csharp
// Load the source DOCM file
using (var merger = new GroupDocs.Merger.Merger("Your Sample Document File"M))
{
    // Add another DOCM file to merge
    merger.Join("Your Sample Document File"M_2);
    // Merge DOCM files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
In this code:
- `"Your Sample Document File"M` and `"Your Sample Document File"M_2` are placeholders for your input DOCM files.
- `merger.Join(...)` adds another DOCM file to the merging process.
- `merger.Save(outputFile)` saves the merged DOCM file to the specified location.
## Step 3: Display Completion Message
Finally, display a message to confirm the merge operation's success:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nDOCM files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
This message informs the user about the successful completion of the merge process and the location of the merged file.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered how to merge DOCM files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. This library simplifies complex document manipulation tasks, providing developers with a robust set of tools to work with various document formats seamlessly within their .NET applications.
