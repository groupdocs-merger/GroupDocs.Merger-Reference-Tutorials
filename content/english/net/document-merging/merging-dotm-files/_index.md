# Merging DOTM Files

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to merge DOTM (Word Macro-Enabled Template) files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. GroupDocs.Merger is a powerful API that allows developers to manipulate and combine various document formats seamlessly within their .NET applications. By following this guide, you'll learn step-by-step how to integrate this functionality into your projects.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
- Development Environment: Install Visual Studio or another compatible IDE for .NET development.
- GroupDocs.Merger for .NET: Download and install the GroupDocs.Merger library from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/net/).
- .NET Framework: Ensure you have the .NET Framework installed on your machine.
- Basic Understanding: Familiarity with C# and .NET programming is beneficial.

## Import Namespaces
Start by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# project to utilize GroupDocs.Merger effectively:
```csharp
using System; 
using GroupDocs.Merger;
using System.IO;
```

Now, let's break down the process of merging DOTM files using GroupDocs.Merger into a series of clear steps:
## Step 1: Set Up Output Directory and File Name
Begin by defining the output directory path and the name of the merged DOTM file.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YourOutputDirectory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.dotm");
```
Replace `"YourOutputDirectory"` with your desired path.
## Step 2: Load and Merge DOTM Files
Initialize the `Merger` object from GroupDocs.Merger with the source DOTM file.
```csharp
using (var merger = new GroupDocs.Merger.Merger("Your Sample File"))
{
    // Add another DOTM file to merge
    merger.Join("Your Sample File");
    // Merge DOTM files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
Here, `"Your Sample File"` and `"Your Sample File"` represent the paths to the DOTM files you want to merge.
## Step 3: Display Merge Completion Message
Inform the user that the merging process has been successfully completed and specify the output folder.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nDOTM files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
This message will appear once the merging operation is finished.

Congratulations! You've learned how to merge DOTM files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. This API empowers you to efficiently manage and combine document formats within your .NET applications, enhancing your document processing capabilities.
