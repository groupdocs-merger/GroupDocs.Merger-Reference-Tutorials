## Introduction
In the realm of document management and manipulation, merging PDF files is a common task that developers encounter. GroupDocs.Merger for .NET provides a robust solution for combining PDF documents seamlessly within .NET applications. This tutorial will guide you through the process of merging PDF files using GroupDocs.Merger, showcasing step-by-step implementation and usage.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Visual Studio installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of C# programming language.
- Access to the GroupDocs.Merger for .NET library.

## Import Namespaces
Begin by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# project:
```csharp
using System; 
using GroupDocs.Merger;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Initialize Output Folder
Set up an output directory where the merged PDF file will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your_Output_Directory_Path";
```
## Step 2: Define Output File Path
Combine the output folder path with the desired name for the merged PDF file:
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.pdf");
```
## Step 3: Load Source PDF Files
Use GroupDocs.Merger to load the source PDF files that you want to merge:
```csharp
using (var merger = new GroupDocs.Merger.Merger("path_to_first_pdf"))
{
    // Add another PDF file to merge
    merger.Join("path_to_second_pdf");
    
    // Merge PDF files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
## Step 4: Execute Merge Operation
Execute the merge operation by joining and saving the PDF files using GroupDocs.Merger:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nPDF files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
