## Introduction
In the world of .NET development, merging RTF (Rich Text Format) files seamlessly is a crucial task for many applications. GroupDocs.Merger for .NET provides a powerful solution to accomplish this efficiently. This tutorial will guide you through the process of merging RTF files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET step by step. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to merge RTF files effortlessly within your .NET projects.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. Development Environment: Install Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE for .NET development.
2. GroupDocs.Merger for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Merger for .NET from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/net/).
3. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language and .NET framework.

## Import Namespaces
First, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# code:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Set up the Output Directory
Begin by defining the output directory where the merged file will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Output Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.rtf");
```
Replace `"Your Output Directory"` with the path to your desired output directory.
## Step 2: Load and Merge RTF Files
Use the `Merger` class from GroupDocs.Merger to load and merge the RTF files:
```csharp
// Load the source RTF file
using (var merger = new Merger(Constants.SAMPLE_RTF))
{
    // Add another RTF file to merge
    merger.Join(Constants.SAMPLE_RTF_2);
    // Merge RTF files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
In this code snippet:
- `Constants.SAMPLE_RTF` and `Constants.SAMPLE_RTF_2` represent the paths to the RTF files you want to merge.
- `merger.Join()` is used to add another RTF file (`Constants.SAMPLE_RTF_2`) to the merging process.
- `merger.Save()` is used to save the merged RTF file to the specified output path (`outputFile`).
## Step 3: Display Success Message
Finally, display a success message indicating the completion of the merging process:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nRTF files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
This message will inform you where the merged RTF file (`merged.rtf`) is located.

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to merge RTF files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. This powerful library simplifies the process of handling RTF files within your .NET applications, enabling you to create robust document processing solutions.
