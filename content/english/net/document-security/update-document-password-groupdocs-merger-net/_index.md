```

## Implementation Guide
### Updating Document Password
#### Overview
Changing a document's password is straightforward with GroupDocs.Merger. This feature ensures your documents remain secure even when you need to update access credentials.

**Steps:**
##### Step 1: Load the Protected Document
First, load the document you wish to modify using the `Merger` class.

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample_protected.pdf";
Merger merger = new Merger(filePath);
```

##### Step 2: Set New Password Options
Use `UpdatePasswordOptions` to define the current and new passwords.

```csharp
// Define password change options
UpdatePasswordOptions updateOptions = new UpdatePasswordOptions("current_password", "new_password");
```

##### Step 3: Apply the Password Change
Invoke the `UpdatePassword` method with your defined options.

```csharp
merger.UpdatePassword(updateOptions);
```

##### Step 4: Save the Updated Document
Finally, save your document to a new file path.

```csharp
string outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/updated_protected.pdf";
merger.Save(outputPath);
```

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure you have write permissions for the output directory.
- Double-check current password accuracy; any typo will lead to an error.

## Practical Applications
1. **Document Security Management**: Regularly updating passwords as part of your document management policy.
2. **User Access Control**: Changing passwords when user roles change, enhancing security.
3. **Integration with Cloud Storage**: Automate password updates for documents stored in cloud solutions like Azure or AWS S3.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance while using GroupDocs.Merger:
- **Resource Usage Guidelines**: Monitor memory usage during operations to prevent bottlenecks.
- **Optimization Tips**: Use asynchronous methods if available, especially when handling large batches of documents.

**Best Practices:**
- Always dispose of `Merger` objects appropriately using `using` statements or manual disposal to free resources.
  
```csharp
using (Merger merger = new Merger(filePath))
{
    // Operations
}
```
