- Basic familiarity with C# and .NET project setup.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Merger for .NET

Setting up the library involves adding it to your project. You can do this using one of the following methods:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Merger
```

**Using Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Merger
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Search for "GroupDocs.Merger" in the NuGet Package Manager and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps

1. **Free Trial:** Access a free trial to test out basic functionalities.
2. **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for extended evaluation purposes.
3. **Purchase:** Consider purchasing a full license for advanced features and support.

To initialize and set up GroupDocs.Merger, use the following code snippet as your starting point:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Merger;
```

This initializes the library, making it ready to handle document processing tasks.

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we will break down the process of splitting a PDF by range with an even/odd filter into manageable steps.

### Step 1: Define File Paths

Start by setting up your input and output file paths. Ensure you replace placeholders with actual directories on your system:

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX_10_PAGES";
string filePathOut = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "{0}_out.docx");
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Merger Object

Create a new instance of the `Merger` class, passing in the file path:

```csharp
using (Merger merger = new Merger(filePath))
{
    // Code to split document goes here
}
```
This object is crucial for handling your document manipulations.

### Step 3: Define Split Options

Set up the range and filtering criteria using `SplitOptions`:

```csharp
SplitOptions splitOptions = new SplitOptions(filePathOut, 3, 7, RangeMode.OddPages);
```

Hereâ€™s what each parameter does:
- **filePathOut:** Template for naming output files.
- **3:** Start page number of the range.
- **7:** End page number of the range.
- **RangeMode.OddPages:** Filter to split only odd pages within the specified range.

### Step 4: Execute Split Operation

Invoke the `Split` method using the defined options:

```csharp
merger.Split(splitOptions);
```

This operation will generate new documents based on your criteria, storing them in the specified output directory.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure file paths are correct and accessible.
- Verify that the document format is supported by GroupDocs.Merger.

## Practical Applications

Let's explore some real-world scenarios where splitting PDFs by range can be invaluable:

1. **Document Archiving:** Organize large contracts or reports into manageable sections for easy retrieval.
2. **Legal Documentation:** Separate case files based on relevance to specific legal arguments.
3. **Educational Material:** Distribute chapters of textbooks as individual PDFs for focused study sessions.

GroupDocs.Merger can also integrate with other document management systems, enhancing your overall workflow efficiency.
