- **Temporary License**: For extended testing without limitations, consider obtaining a temporary license.
- **Purchase**: If GroupDocs.Merger meets your needs, you can purchase a full license for continued use.

### Basic Initialization

Once installed, initialize GroupDocs.Merger in your project:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Merger;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string filePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.docm";
        
        using (var merger = new Merger(filePath))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("File loaded successfully.");
            // Ready for further operations like merging or splitting.
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's explore the core functionalities: loading a DOCM file and merging multiple DOCM files.

### Load a DOCM File

This feature demonstrates how to load a Microsoft Word Macro-Enabled Document (.docm) using GroupDocs.Merger.

#### Overview

Loading documents is the first step in any manipulation process. It sets the stage for subsequent operations like merging or splitting.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up the File Path**: Define the path to your DOCM file.
2. **Initialize Merger Object**: Create an instance of the `Merger` class with your file path.

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Merger;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string filePath = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.docm");

        // Load the DOCM file using GroupDocs.Merger
        using (var merger = new Merger(filePath))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("File loaded successfully.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Merge Multiple DOCM Files into a Single File

Combining several documents into one can streamline workflows and simplify document management.

#### Overview

This feature enables you to merge two or more DOCM files into a single file, preserving the integrity of each source document.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Define Source Files**: Specify the paths for the DOCM files you want to merge.
2. **Initialize Merger Object with First File**: Start by loading the first document.
3. **Add Additional Files**: Use the `Join` method to add more documents to be merged.
4. **Save Merged Document**: Output the combined file to a specified location.

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Merger;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string sourceFilePath1 = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.docm");
        string sourceFilePath2 = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample2.docm");

        // Define the output directory and file path
        string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
        string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.docm");

        // Load the first DOCM source file
        using (var merger = new Merger(sourceFilePath1))
        {
            // Add another DOCM file to merge
            merger.Join(sourceFilePath2);

            // Save the merged document to the specified output path
            merger.Save(outputFile);
            
            Console.WriteLine("Documents merged successfully.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Ensure File Paths are Correct**: Double-check your directory paths to avoid file not found errors.
- **Check File Permissions**: Make sure your application has the necessary permissions to read and write files in specified directories.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Merger for .NET is versatile, offering a range of applications:
