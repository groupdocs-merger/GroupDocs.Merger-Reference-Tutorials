- Obtain a **temporary license** for extended testing.
- Purchase a full license for production use.

Once installed, set up your environment by creating directories for documents and output:

```csharp
using System.IO;

string documentDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY");
string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");

if (!Directory.Exists(documentDirectory))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(documentDirectory);
}

if (!Directory.Exists(outputDirectory))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Merging Multiple XLT Files

This feature allows you to combine several Excel Template files into one. Let's break it down step by step.

#### Overview
The goal is to load multiple `.xlt` files and merge them, saving the output in a new file.

#### Loading Files and Merging

1. **Load the First XLT File**
   
   Begin by loading your first XLT file using GroupDocs.Merger:
   ```csharp
   string sourceXltPath1 = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.xlt");
   using (var merger = new Merger(sourceXltPath1))
   {
       // Additional steps will follow...
   }
   ```

2. **Join the Second XLT File**
   
   Add another file to merge:
   ```csharp
   string sourceXltPath2 = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample2.xlt");
   merger.Join(sourceXltPath2);
   ```

3. **Save the Merged File**
   
   Save your merged result as a new XLT file:
   ```csharp
   string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "merged.xlt");
   merger.Save(outputFile);
   ```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all source files exist and paths are correctly specified.
- Check for sufficient permissions to read/write in the directories.

## Practical Applications

Merging XLT files can be useful in various scenarios:
1. **Financial Reporting:** Combine monthly reports into a single file for quarterly analysis.
2. **Project Management:** Merge templates used by different teams into one master template.
3. **Data Consolidation:** Integrate data from various Excel templates for comprehensive datasets.

Integration with other systems, such as databases or web applications, can further enhance the utility of merged XLT files.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large numbers of files or substantial file sizes:
- Optimize performance by managing memory usage effectively.
- Use asynchronous operations where possible to improve responsiveness.
- Follow best practices in .NET for efficient resource management and exception handling with GroupDocs.Merger.
