```

## Implementation Guide

### Merge Specific Pages from Documents Using PageBuilder

This feature allows you to combine specific pages from multiple PDFs using the `PageBuilder` class.

#### Overview
The `PageBuilder` class provides a flexible way to select and merge desired pages from different documents into one output file.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### 1. Define File Paths
Set up your input and output directories with placeholders for flexibility:

```csharp
string filePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.pdf");
string filePathOut = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "result.pdf");
```

##### 2. Initialize the Merger
Create an instance of `Merger` with the first document:

```csharp
using (Merger merger = new Merger(filePath))
{
    // Proceed to add and configure pages
}
```
The `Merger` class handles multiple documents.

##### 3. Add a Second Document
Add another document you wish to merge specific pages from:

```csharp
merger.Join(Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample2.pdf"));
```

##### 4. Create and Configure PageBuilder
Initialize the `PageBuilder` to select specific pages:

```csharp
PageBuilder pageBuilder = merger.CreatePageBuilder();
// Add desired pages using indices
pageBuilder.AddPage(pageBuilder.Documents[1].Pages[0]); // 1st page from second document
pageBuilder.AddPage(pageBuilder.Documents[0].Pages[1]); // 2nd page from first document
pageBuilder.AddPage(pageBuilder.Documents[1].Pages[1]); // 2nd page from second document
```

##### 5. Apply PageBuilder Configuration
Apply the selected pages to the merger:

```csharp
merger.ApplyPageBuilder(pageBuilder);
```

##### 6. Save the Merged Document
Save your merged output:

```csharp
merger.Save(filePathOut);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all file paths are correct and accessible.
- Validate page indices to prevent out-of-range errors.

### File Path Configuration Using Placeholder Directories

Efficiently managing file paths is crucial for maintaining code portability. Set up placeholder directories like this:

```csharp
string inputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.pdf");
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "result.pdf");

Console.WriteLine($"Input File: {inputFilePath}");
Console.WriteLine($"Output File: {outputFilePath}");
```

## Practical Applications

Merging specific PDF pages is invaluable in scenarios like:
1. **Report Compilation**: Combine executive summaries from different reports into a single document.
2. **Invoice Management**: Merge relevant invoice sections for financial auditing.
3. **Presentation Preparation**: Extract and combine slides from various presentations for a unified view.

These use cases demonstrate the flexibility of GroupDocs.Merger in handling complex document workflows.

## Performance Considerations

Optimizing performance is essential when dealing with large documents:
- Limit memory usage by processing pages in batches if possible.
- Manage resource allocation effectively to prevent application slowdowns.
- Follow best practices for .NET memory management, such as disposing of objects properly.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to merge specific PDF pages using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. By following the outlined steps, you can efficiently combine documents tailored to your needs.

To further enhance your skills, explore additional features of GroupDocs.Merger and integrate them into larger projects. Happy coding!
