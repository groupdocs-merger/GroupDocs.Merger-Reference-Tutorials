- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of C# and .NET programming is recommended.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Merger for .NET

To start merging PPSX files, set up GroupDocs.Merger. Here’s how:

### Installation Options

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Merger
```

**Package Manager:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Merger
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
Search for "GroupDocs.Merger" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

- **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to test features.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase:** Buy a license for full access if you find it beneficial.

#### Basic Initialization

Import GroupDocs.Merger in your project and create an instance of the `Merger` class. This will be your starting point for loading files to merge.

## Implementation Guide

Now, let’s walk through the implementation process step-by-step.

### Loading a Source PPSX File

#### Overview
Loading a source file is essential as it serves as the base document that other presentations will merge into.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Set Up Path**
   Use `Path.Combine` to define the directory and filename of your source PPSX.
   ```csharp
   string samplePpsxPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.ppsx");
   ```
2. **Load Source File into Merger Object**
   Initialize a new instance of the `Merger` class with the file path.
   ```csharp
   using (var merger = new Merger(samplePpsxPath))
   {
       // The source PPSX is now loaded and ready for further operations
   }
   ```

### Adding Another PPSX File to Merge

#### Overview
To merge multiple presentations, add additional files into your merger object.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Set Path for Additional File**
   Define the path for the additional presentation file.
   ```csharp
   string additionalPpsxPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "additional.ppsx");
   ```
2. **Merge Files**
   Use the `Join` method to add this file into your existing merger object.
   ```csharp
   merger.Join(additionalPpsxPath);
   // The additional PPSX file has been added for merging
   ```

### Saving Merged Output File

#### Overview
After adding all required files, save the merged presentation as a single output document.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Set Output Path**
   Define where and under what name your merged presentation will be saved.
   ```csharp
   string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "merged.ppsx");
   ```
2. **Save Merged File**
   Call the `Save` method on your merger object to write out the merged document.
   ```csharp
   merger.Save(outputFile);
   // The merged PPSX file is now saved at the specified path
   ```

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Merger for .NET offers versatile use cases beyond just merging PowerPoint presentations. Here are a few:
