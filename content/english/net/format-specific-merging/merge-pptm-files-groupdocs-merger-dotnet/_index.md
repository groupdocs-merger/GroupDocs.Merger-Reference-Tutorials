## Implementation Guide
### Merge PPTM Files with Ease
Follow these steps to merge PowerPoint Open XML files using **GroupDocs.Merger for .NET**.
#### Step 1: Define Paths and Load the Source File
Start by setting up paths for your input and output directories. Replace placeholders with actual directory paths:
```csharp
string inputDirectory = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

using (var merger = new Merger(Path.Combine(inputDirectory, "sample1.pptm")))
{
    // Explanation: 'merger' is initialized with the first PowerPoint file to set as a base for merging.
```
#### Step 2: Add Additional Files
Next, add other PPTM files you wish to merge:
```csharp
    merger.Join(Path.Combine(inputDirectory, "sample2.pptm"));
    // Explanation: 'Join' method merges another document into the existing one.
```
#### Step 3: Save the Merged File
Finally, define an output path and save your merged file:
```csharp
    string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "merged.pptm");
    merger.Save(outputFile);
    // Explanation: The 'Save' method writes the combined document to the specified location.
}
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all `.pptm` files are accessible and have correct paths.
- Check for sufficient disk space in your output directory.
## Practical Applications
Merging PowerPoint presentations is valuable in various scenarios, such as:
