- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for full-feature testing without limitations.
- **Purchase:** Acquire a full license for commercial use.

### Basic Initialization
Create an instance of the `Merger` class by providing your source XLTM file path. This prepares you for further merging operations.

## Implementation Guide
We'll break down the process into manageable steps, focusing on each feature individually.

### Step 1: Load Source XLTM File
**Overview:** Start by loading a source XLTM file using GroupDocs.Merger to prepare it for subsequent operations like merging.

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Merger;

string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SAMPLE_XLTM";

// Initialize the Merger with the source XLTM file path
using (var merger = new Merger(documentPath))
{
    // The source XLTM file is now loaded and ready for further operations.
}
```
**Explanation:** This code snippet initializes the `Merger` object, crucial for any merging operation. By specifying your XLTM file path, you set up your environment for subsequent actions.

### Step 2: Add Another XLTM File to Merge
**Overview:** Once your source file is loaded, add additional XLTM files for merging into a single document.

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Merger;

string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SAMPLE_XLTM";
string additionalDocumentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SAMPLE_XLTM_2";

// Initialize Merger with the source XLTM file path
using (var merger = new Merger(documentPath))
{
    // Add another XLTM file for merging using the Join method
    merger.Join(additionalDocumentPath);
    // The additional XLTM file is now part of the merge operation.
}
```
**Explanation:** The `Join` method adds another document to your existing Merger instance, combining multiple XLTM files into one.

### Step 3: Merge XLTM Files and Save Result
**Overview:** After merging, save the result in a specified output directory.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Merger;

string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SAMPLE_XLTM";
string additionalDocumentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SAMPLE_XLTM_2";
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.xltm");

// Initialize Merger with the source XLTM file path
using (var merger = new Merger(documentPath))
{
    // Add another XLTM file for merging using the Join method
    merger.Join(additionalDocumentPath);
    
    // Save the merged result into the specified output directory and file
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
**Explanation:** The `Save` method writes your merged document to your desired location, finalizing the process.
