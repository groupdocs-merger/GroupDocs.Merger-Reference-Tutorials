### Basic Initialization and Setup
To initialize GroupDocs.Merger in your project:

// Initialize the Merger with an input PDF file path
Merger merger = new Merger("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide
In this section, we'll walk through merging images into a single PDF document using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET.

### Joining Images to a PDF Document
This feature allows you to combine multiple image formats such as JPG and SVG into one PDF file. Here's how:

#### Step 1: Initialize Merger with an Input PDF File
```csharp
using (Merger merger = new Merger("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pdf"))
{
    // This is where we will add images to the PDF.
}
```
**Explanation**: By initializing `Merger` with your base PDF file, you set up a starting point for adding other files.

#### Step 2: Join a JPG Image
```csharp
string imagePathJPG = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.jpg";
merger.Join(imagePathJPG);
```
**Explanation**: The `Join` method appends the specified image to your existing PDF document. Ensure the path is correct and accessible.

#### Step 3: Join an SVG Image
```csharp
string imagePathSVG = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.svg";
merger.Join(imagePathSVG);
```
**Explanation**: This step adds another image format (SVG) into the PDF, showcasing GroupDocs.Merger's versatility with different file types.

#### Step 4: Save the Merged Document
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output_merged.pdf");
merger.Save(outputPath);
```
**Explanation**: The `Save` method finalizes your changes and writes the combined document to the specified path. Ensure your output directory exists.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Not Found Errors**: Double-check file paths for correctness.
- **Library Initialization Issues**: Verify that GroupDocs.Merger is correctly installed and referenced in your project.
- **Memory Management**: Close any unnecessary files or streams to free up resources during large operations.

## Practical Applications

### Business Reporting
Combine various report visuals into a single, easy-to-distribute PDF document.

### Presentation Preparation
Merge presentation slides and supplementary images for streamlined sharing.

### Portfolio Compilation
Assemble multiple project images into one professional portfolio PDF.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance while using GroupDocs.Merger:
- **Optimize Image Sizes**: Pre-process images to reduce file size before merging.
- **Memory Management**: Utilize `using` statements for automatic resource cleanup in .NET applications.
- **Batch Processing**: If dealing with numerous files, consider processing them in batches.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you've learned how to use GroupDocs.Merger for .NET to efficiently join images into a single PDF document. This functionality is crucial for creating comprehensive reports and presentations without the hassle of manual file management.
