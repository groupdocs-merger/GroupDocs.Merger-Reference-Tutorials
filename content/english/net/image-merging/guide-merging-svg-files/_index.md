## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to merge SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. GroupDocs.Merger is a powerful document manipulation API that allows you to merge, split, and manipulate various document formats seamlessly. By following this step-by-step guide, you'll be able to combine multiple SVG files into a single SVG file using C#.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Visual Studio installed on your system
- Basic understanding of C# programming language
- Access to the GroupDocs.Merger for .NET library
- Access to sample SVG files for merging

## Import Namespaces

First, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# project to use GroupDocs.Merger functionalities.

```csharp
using System; 
using GroupDocs.Merger;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Setting Up the Output Directory

Before merging SVG files, define the output directory where the merged SVG file will be saved.

```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Output Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.svg");
```

Replace `"Your Output Directory"` with the desired path where you want to save the merged SVG file.

## Step 2: Loading and Merging SVG Files

Next, load the source SVG files and specify how you want to join them (in this case, vertically) using GroupDocs.Merger.

```csharp
using (var merger = new Merger("Your Sample File"))
{
    // Define image join options with vertical join mode
    var joinOptions = new ImageJoinOptions(ImageJoinMode.Vertical);
    // Add another SVG file to merge
    merger.Join("Your Sample File", joinOptions);
    // Merge SVG files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```

Here:
- `"Your Sample File"` represents the path to your source SVG file.
- `ImageJoinMode.Vertical` specifies that the SVG files should be joined vertically.

## Step 3: Running the Merging Process

Execute the merging process and save the resulting merged SVG file to the specified output directory.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nSVG files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```

This code will display a success message in the console once the SVG files are merged successfully.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to merge SVG files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. By following these steps, you can efficiently combine multiple SVG documents into a single file programmatically.
