## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to merge TIFF files using the GroupDocs.Merger for .NET library. GroupDocs.Merger is a powerful document manipulation API that allows developers to merge, split, and modify various document formats seamlessly within .NET applications.
## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio IDE for .NET development.
2. GroupDocs.Merger for .NET: Download and install the GroupDocs.Merger library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language and .NET development.

## Import Namespaces
Begin by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```

Follow these steps to merge TIFF files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET:
## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File
Start by defining the output directory and file name where the merged TIFF file will be saved.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Output Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.tiff");
```
## Step 2: Load Source TIFF File
Initialize the `Merger` object by loading the source TIFF file.
```csharp
using (var merger = new Merger(Constants.SAMPLE_TIFF))
{
    // Define image join options with vertical join mode
    var joinOptions = new ImageJoinOptions(ImageJoinMode.Vertical);
    // Add another TIFF file to merge
    merger.Join(Constants.SAMPLE_TIFF, joinOptions);
    // Merge TIFF files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
## Step 3: Execute Merging Process
Execute the merging process by joining the source TIFF file with additional files using defined options and save the merged file.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nTIFF files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to merge TIFF files programmatically using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. This versatile library simplifies document manipulation tasks within .NET applications, offering robust capabilities for merging and modifying various file formats.
