# How to Rotate JPG Images in .NET Using GroupDocs.Merger

## Introduction

Are you tired of manually rotating images or dealing with complex software just to turn a picture by 90 degrees? With **GroupDocs.Merger for .NET**, you can automate this process effortlessly and efficiently. This tutorial will guide you through rotating JPG images using C#, leveraging the capabilities of GroupDocs.Merger.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up your environment with GroupDocs.Merger
- Rotating a JPG image using C#
- Practical applications for image rotation in .NET

By the end of this guide, you’ll have the skills needed to implement image rotations seamlessly into your projects. Let's start by covering the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
- **GroupDocs.Merger for .NET**: This library handles the image rotation functionality.
  
### Environment Setup Requirements
- .NET Framework (version 4.6.1 or later)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET programming concepts.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Merger for .NET

To get started with GroupDocs.Merger, you need to install the package in your project. Here's how you can do it using different tools:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Merger
```

**Using Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Merger
```

**Using NuGet Package Manager UI:**
Search for "GroupDocs.Merger" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps

- **Free Trial**: Start with a trial to explore basic functionalities.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain this from GroupDocs if you need more time to test features without limitations.
- **Purchase**: For long-term use, consider purchasing a license. Visit [GroupDocs Purchase](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization and Setup

To initialize GroupDocs.Merger in your .NET project, create an instance of the `Merger` class with your image file path:

```csharp
using (Merger merger = new Merger("path/to/your/image.jpg"))
{
    // Perform operations on the image.
}
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll break down the steps to rotate a JPG image by 90 degrees using GroupDocs.Merger.

### Rotating an Image by 90 Degrees

**Overview**: We’ll be rotating an image file named `sample.jpg` and saving it as `rotated_sample.jpg`.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths

Start by specifying the paths for your input and output files:

```csharp
string filePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.jpg");
string filePathOut = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "rotated_sample.jpg");
```

**Explanation**: Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` and `"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"` with actual directory paths.

#### Step 2: Set Up Rotation Options

Create an instance of `RotateOptions` to specify the rotation mode:

```csharp
RotateOptions rotateOptions = new RotateOptions(RotateMode.Rotate90);
```

**Why this is important**: The `RotateOptions` class defines how and by what degree the image should be rotated.

#### Step 3: Perform the Rotation

Use the `Merger` class to load your image, apply rotation, and save it:

```csharp
using (Merger merger = new Merger(filePath))
{
    merger.Rotate(rotateOptions);
    merger.Save(filePathOut);
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- **merger.Rotate(rotateOptions)**: Rotates the image according to the specified options.
- **merger.Save(filePathOut)**: Saves the rotated image to your desired output path.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correct and accessible.
- Check for any permissions issues on directories.
- Validate that GroupDocs.Merger is correctly installed and referenced in your project.

## Practical Applications

Rotating images programmatically can be incredibly useful. Here are some real-world scenarios:

1. **Automated Document Processing**: Rotate scanned documents to the desired orientation before further processing.
2. **Photo Management Applications**: Automatically adjust photo orientations based on metadata.
3. **Web Development**: Serve correctly oriented images dynamically without manual adjustments.

## Performance Considerations

When working with image processing, performance is key. Here are some tips for optimizing GroupDocs.Merger:

- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Ensure you dispose of objects like `Merger` instances to free up resources.
- **Best Practices**: Use asynchronous methods if available and handle exceptions gracefully.

## Conclusion
