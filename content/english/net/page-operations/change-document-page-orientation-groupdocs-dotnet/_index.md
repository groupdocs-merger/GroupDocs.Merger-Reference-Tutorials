## Implementation Guide

Let's delve into implementing the feature of changing document page orientation.

### Overview: Changing Page Orientation

Changing a document’s page orientation involves selecting specific pages and setting them to landscape or portrait. We'll use GroupDocs.Merger to accomplish this task with precision.

#### Step 1: Set Up Your File Paths
Begin by specifying your input and output directory paths:

```csharp
string inputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "your_input_file.docx");
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output_file.docx");
```

#### Step 2: Define Orientation Options
Create an instance of `OrientationOptions` to specify pages and orientation mode:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Merger.Domain.Options;

// Specify pages (3, 4) and set the orientation to Landscape
OrientationOptions orientationOptions = new OrientationOptions(OrientationMode.Landscape, new int[] { 3, 4 });
```

#### Step 3: Load and Modify the Document
Use the `Merger` class to load your document, change its orientation, and save it:

```csharp
using (Merger merger = new Merger(inputFilePath))
{
    // Change the orientation of specified pages
    merger.ChangeOrientation(orientationOptions);

    // Save the updated document to the output path
    merger.Save(outputFilePath);
}
```

### Key Configuration Options
- **OrientationMode**: Choose between `Landscape` or `Portrait`.
- **Page Numbers Array**: Specify which pages should change orientation.

### Troubleshooting Tips
Common issues and their solutions:
- **File Not Found Error:** Ensure file paths are correct.
- **Permission Denied:** Check access rights to the directories involved.
- **Invalid Page Numbers:** Verify that page numbers exist within the document range.

## Practical Applications
The ability to adjust page orientation can be beneficial in several real-world scenarios:
1. **Print Layouts**: Enhance readability of tables or wide images by switching certain pages to landscape.
2. **Mixed Document Reports**: Combine portrait and landscape sections seamlessly for reports and presentations.
3. **Integration with CMS**: Automate document formatting adjustments when publishing content through a Content Management System (CMS).
4. **Batch Processing**: Implement in batch processes where multiple documents require orientation adjustments.

## Performance Considerations
Optimizing performance is essential:
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor memory usage, especially during large batch operations.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Dispose of `Merger` objects promptly using `using` statements.
  - Keep file paths and document sizes manageable to avoid excessive load times.
