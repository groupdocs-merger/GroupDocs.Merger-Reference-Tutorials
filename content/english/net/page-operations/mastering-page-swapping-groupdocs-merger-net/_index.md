## Implementation Guide

Now that you’re set up, let’s implement page swapping. We’ll break this down into clear steps.

### Overview of Page Swapping

Swapping pages allows you to rearrange documents without manual adjustments, saving time and minimizing errors.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths and Pages
Specify the paths for your input and output files along with the pages you wish to swap:

```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.pptx"; // Replace with your document path
string filePathOut = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SwappedSample.pptx"); // Output file path
int pageNumber1 = 3; // The first page number to swap
int pageNumber2 = 6; // The second page number to swap
```

#### Step 2: Create Swap Options
Initialize the `SwapOptions` with the pages you want to exchange:

```csharp
SwapOptions swapOptions = new SwapOptions(pageNumber2, pageNumber1);
```

#### Step 3: Perform Page Swapping
Use the `Merger` class to load your document and execute the swap operation:

```csharp
using (Merger merger = new Merger(filePath))
{
    // Execute the page swapping
    merger.SwapPages(swapOptions);

    // Save the modified document
    merger.Save(filePathOut);
}
```

### Explanation of Parameters:
- `filePath`: The path to your source document.
- `filePathOut`: Path where the modified document will be saved.
- `SwapOptions`: Specifies which pages to swap.

## Practical Applications

Understanding how page swapping can benefit your projects is crucial. Here are some scenarios:

1. **Presentation Refinement**: Quickly rearrange slides for better flow during presentations.
2. **Contract Adjustments**: Modify contract documents efficiently without manual reordering.
3. **Report Customization**: Tailor reports to meet specific audience needs by adjusting the order of sections.

Integration with other systems, like document management solutions or content delivery networks, can further enhance functionality and reach.
