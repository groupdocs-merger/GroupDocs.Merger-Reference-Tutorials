## Implementation Guide

### Rotating Specific Pages of a PDF

#### Overview

Rotating specific pages within a PDF document is essential for applications like adjusting scanned documents or preparing files for printing. GroupDocs.Merger provides an intuitive way to achieve this.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### 1. Load the Document

Start by loading your PDF file using the `Merger` class:

```csharp
using (Merger merger = new Merger(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\SamplePDF.pdf"))
{
    // Proceed with rotating pages
}
```

##### 2. Define Rotation Options

Use `RotateOptions` to specify which pages to rotate and the angle of rotation (90, 180, or 270 degrees):

```csharp
var rotateOptions = new RotateOptions(1, 3, RotateMode.On90Clockwise); // Rotates pages 1-3 by 90 degrees clockwise
```

**Parameters Explained:**
- `RotateOptions(int startPageNumber, int endPageNumber, RotateMode mode)`: Define the range of pages and rotation mode.
- `RotateMode`: Enum that specifies the rotation angle (On90Clockwise, On180, On270CounterClockwise).

##### 3. Apply Rotation

Invoke the `RotatePages` method to apply your specified rotations:

```csharp
merger.RotatePages(rotateOptions);
```

##### 4. Save the Modified Document

Finally, save the changes by specifying an output path:

```csharp
merger.Save(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\\RotatedSamplePDF.pdf");
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Issues**: Ensure that your file paths are correct and accessible.
- **Incorrect Page Numbers**: Double-check the page numbers you've specified to avoid errors.

## Practical Applications

1. **Document Preparation for Printing**: Adjust scanned documents' orientations before printing.
2. **User-Specified Adjustments**: Allow users to rotate specific pages within an online document editor.
3. **Automated Report Generation**: Ensure all reports are oriented correctly before distribution.
4. **Data Extraction and Formatting**: Rotate extracted sections of PDFs for better readability or analysis.
5. **Integration with Document Management Systems**: Seamlessly integrate rotation features into existing enterprise solutions.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Merger:
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of the `Merger` object properly to free resources:
  ```csharp
  merger.Dispose();
  ```
- **Batch Processing**: Process documents in batches if dealing with a large number of files.
- **Optimized Settings**: Adjust settings like cache size and timeout based on your application's needs.
