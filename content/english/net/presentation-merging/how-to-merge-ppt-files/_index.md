using (var merger = new GroupDocs.Merger.Merger("Path_To_Source_PPT_File"))
```
## Step 4: Add Another PPT File to Merge
To add another PowerPoint file for merging, use the `Join` method:
```csharp
merger.Join("Path_To_Another_PPT_File");
```
## Step 5: Save Merged PPT File
Execute the merge operation and save the result to the specified output file:
```csharp
merger.Save(outputFile);
```
## Step 6: Display Completion Message
Finally, notify the user that the merge process is completed and provide the path to the merged file:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nPPT files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
