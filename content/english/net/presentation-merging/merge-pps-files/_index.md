## Introduction
In the world of .NET development, manipulating document files efficiently is crucial. GroupDocs.Merger for .NET provides powerful tools to merge and manipulate various document formats seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll focus on merging PPS (PowerPoint Slide Show) files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this guide will walk you through the process step-by-step.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of C# programming.
- Access to GroupDocs.Merger for .NET library.
- Sample PPS files for merging.

## Import Namespaces
First, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces into your C# project to access the GroupDocs.Merger functionalities:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Output Directory
Begin by defining the output directory path where the merged file will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YourOutputDirectory";
```
Replace `"YourOutputDirectory"` with the path where you want to save the merged file.
## Step 2: Define Output File Path
Next, specify the path for the output merged PPS file:
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.pps");
```
This will create a path for the output file named `"merged.pps"` inside the defined output directory.
## Step 3: Load and Merge PPS Files
Use the GroupDocs.Merger library to load and merge the PPS files:
```csharp
using (var merger = new GroupDocs.Merger.Merger("PathToYourFirstPPSFile"))
{
    merger.Join("PathToYourSecondPPSFile");
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
Replace `"PathToYourFirstPPSFile"` and `"PathToYourSecondPPSFile"` with the paths to your actual PPS files. The `Join` method is used to add additional PPS files to the merger.
## Step 4: Save Merged File
Finally, save the merged PPS file using the specified output path:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nPPS files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
This line will display a success message in the console along with the location where the merged file is saved.
