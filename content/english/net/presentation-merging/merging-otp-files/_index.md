## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to merge OTP (OpenDocument Presentation Template) files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. GroupDocs.Merger is a powerful document manipulation API that allows developers to combine, split, and manipulate various file formats seamlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of C# programming.
- GroupDocs.Merger for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/net/).

## Import Namespaces
Start by including the necessary namespaces in your C# project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Output Directory
First, define the directory where you want to save the merged OTP file:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Output Directory";
```
## Step 2: Merge OTP Files
Now, specify the path for the merged OTP file and initialize the `Merger` object with the source OTP file:
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.otp");
using (var merger = new Merger(Constants.SAMPLE_OTP))
{
    // Add another OTP file to merge
    merger.Join(Constants.SAMPLE_OTP_2);
    
    // Merge OTP files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
## Step 3: Run and Check Output
Execute the code to merge the OTP files. After successful execution, you will see a message indicating the completion of the merging process:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nOTP files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
