## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to merge XLTX (Excel Template) files. GroupDocs.Merger is a powerful document manipulation API that enables developers to combine, split, and manipulate various document formats seamlessly within .NET applications. This tutorial specifically focuses on merging XLTX files programmatically.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
- Development Environment: Install Visual Studio or any .NET-supported IDE.
- GroupDocs.Merger for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Merger for .NET from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/net/).
- Sample XLTX Files: Prepare the XLTX files you intend to merge for testing.

## Import Namespaces
To get started, include the necessary namespaces in your project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Initialize Output Directory
Begin by defining the output directory path where the merged XLTX file will be saved.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your_Output_Directory_Path";
```
## Step 2: Set Output File Path
Specify the full path for the merged XLTX file.
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.xltx");
```
## Step 3: Merge XLTX Files
Load the source XLTX files, merge them, and save the result to the specified output file.
```csharp
// Load the source XLTX file
using (var merger = new GroupDocs.Merger.Merger("Path_To_First_XLTX_File"))
{
    // Add another XLTX file to merge
    merger.Join("Path_To_Second_XLTX_File");
    // Merge XLTX files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
## Step 4: Handle Output
Finally, display a message confirming the successful completion of the merge operation and specify the location of the merged XLTX file.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nXLTX files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
