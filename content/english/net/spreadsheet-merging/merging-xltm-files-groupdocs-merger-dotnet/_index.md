## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to merge XLTM (Excel Macro-Enabled Template) files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. GroupDocs.Merger for .NET is a powerful library that enables developers to manipulate and merge various document formats programmatically. This guide will walk you through the process of merging XLTM files step by step using C#.
## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Visual Studio installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of C# programming.
- GroupDocs.Merger for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/net/).
- Access to XLTM files that you want to merge.

## Import Namespaces
Begin by importing the necessary namespaces into your C# project.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```

Now, let's dive into merging XLTM files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET.
## Step 1: Initialize Output Directory
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
string outputFolder = "Your Output Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.xltm");
```
Replace `"Your Output Directory"` with the path where you want to save the merged XLTM file.
## Step 2: Merge XLTM Files
```csharp
// Load the source XLTM file
using (var merger = new GroupDocs.Merger.Merger(Constants.SAMPLE_XLTM))
{
    // Add another XLTM file to merge
    merger.Join(Constants.SAMPLE_XLTM_2);
    // Merge XLTM files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
In this code snippet:
- `Constants.SAMPLE_XLTM` and `Constants.SAMPLE_XLTM_2` represent the paths to your input XLTM files. Ensure to replace these with the actual file paths.
## Step 3: Display Output Location
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nXLTM files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
This code will display a message indicating the successful completion of the merge operation along with the output directory path.

## Conclusion
By following this tutorial, you've learned how to merge XLTM files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. This library offers extensive capabilities for document manipulation, providing developers with a robust toolset for handling document-related tasks programmatically.
