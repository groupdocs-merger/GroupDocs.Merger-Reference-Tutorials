## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to merge VSSM (Visio Macro-Enabled Drawing) files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. GroupDocs.Merger is a powerful library that enables developers to manipulate and merge various document formats seamlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following set up:
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- GroupDocs.Merger for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/net/).
- Basic knowledge of C# programming.

## Import Namespaces
To get started, import the necessary namespaces for using GroupDocs.Merger in your C# project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Output Directory and File Paths
Create variables to define the output directory and file paths where the merged VSSM file will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YourOutputDirectory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.vssm");
```
Replace `"YourOutputDirectory"` with the path where you want to save the merged VSSM file.
## Step 2: Merge VSSM Files
Load the source VSSM file, add another VSSM file to merge, and then save the merged output to the specified file path:
```csharp
using (var merger = new GroupDocs.Merger.Merger(Constants.SAMPLE_VSSM))
{
    // Add another VSSM file to merge
    merger.Join(Constants.SAMPLE_VSSM_2);
    // Merge VSSM files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
Console.WriteLine("\nVSSM files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
In the code snippet above:
- `Constants.SAMPLE_VSSM` and `Constants.SAMPLE_VSSM_2` represent the paths to the VSSM files you want to merge. Replace these with the actual file paths.
