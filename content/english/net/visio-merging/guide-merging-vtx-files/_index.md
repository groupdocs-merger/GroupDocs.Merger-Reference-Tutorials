## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to merge VTX (Visio Drawing Template) files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. GroupDocs.Merger for .NET is a powerful document manipulation API that allows developers to work with various file formats, including VTX files.
## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following set up:
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- GroupDocs.Merger for .NET library downloaded and referenced in your project.
- Basic knowledge of C# programming.

## Import Namespaces
Begin by importing the necessary namespaces into your C# project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Load the Source VTX File
First, define an output directory and file name where you want to save the merged VTX file:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YourOutputDirectory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.vtx");
```
## Step 2: Initialize and Use GroupDocs.Merger
Now, use the GroupDocs.Merger library to load and merge VTX files:
```csharp
// Load the source VTX file
using (var merger = new GroupDocs.Merger.Merger(Constants.SAMPLE_VTX))
{
    // Add another VTX file to merge
    merger.Join(Constants.SAMPLE_VTX_2);
    // Merge VTX files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
Console.WriteLine("\nVTX files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
