## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to merge VDX (Visio Drawing XML) files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. GroupDocs.Merger is a powerful document manipulation API that allows seamless merging of various file formats, including VDX files. This tutorial will guide you through the process of merging VDX files step by step using C# in a .NET environment.
## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following:
- Visual Studio: Installed on your machine.
- GroupDocs.Merger for .NET: Downloaded and referenced in your project. You can get it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/net/).
- Sample VDX Files: Have one or more VDX files ready to merge.

## Import Namespaces
First, include the necessary namespaces in your C# code:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Set up Output Directory
Begin by defining the directory where you want to save the merged VDX file:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Output Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.vdx");
```
Replace `"Your Output Directory"` with your desired directory path.
## Step 2: Merge VDX Files
Load the source VDX file and add other VDX files to merge:
```csharp
// Load the source VDX file
using (var merger = new GroupDocs.Merger.Merger(Constants.SAMPLE_VDX))
{
    // Add another VDX file to merge
    merger.Join(Constants.SAMPLE_VDX_2);
    // Merge VDX files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
Replace `Constants.SAMPLE_VDX` and `Constants.SAMPLE_VDX_2` with the paths to your actual VDX files.
## Step 3: Save and Confirm
Finally, display a message indicating successful completion and check the output:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nVDX files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
This code will merge the specified VDX files and save the result in the specified output directory.
