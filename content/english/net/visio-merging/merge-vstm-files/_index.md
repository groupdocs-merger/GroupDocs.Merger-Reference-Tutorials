## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to merge VSTM (VSTemplate) files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. GroupDocs.Merger is a powerful document manipulation API that allows developers to merge, split, and manipulate various document formats seamlessly within their .NET applications.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio IDE on your development machine.
2. GroupDocs.Merger for .NET: Obtain and install the GroupDocs.Merger for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/net/).
3. .NET Framework: Ensure you have .NET Framework installed (version 4.6.1 or above).
4. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language.

## Import Namespaces
Before diving into the code, make sure to import the necessary namespaces in your C# project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Set Output Directory
First, specify the output directory where the merged file will be saved.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Output Directory";
```
## Step 2: Define Output File Path
Combine the output directory with the desired output file name.
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.vstm");
```
## Step 3: Load Source VSTM File
Initialize the `Merger` object by loading the source VSTM file.
```csharp
using (var merger = new GroupDocs.Merger.Merger(Constants.SAMPLE_VSTM))
{
    // Add another VSTM file to merge
    merger.Join(Constants.SAMPLE_VSTM_2);
    // Merge VSTM files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
## Step 4: Merge and Save
Add additional VSTM files to the `Merger` object using the `Join` method, then merge them together and save the result to the specified output file.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nVSTM files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have covered the essential steps to merge VSTM files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. By following these steps and utilizing the powerful capabilities of the GroupDocs.Merger library, you can efficiently manipulate VSTM files within your .NET applications.
