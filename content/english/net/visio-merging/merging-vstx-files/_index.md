# Merging VSTX Files with GroupDocs.Merger for .NET

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will delve into how to merge VSTX files using GroupDocs.Merger for .NET. GroupDocs.Merger for .NET is a powerful library that allows developers to manipulate various document formats seamlessly within their .NET applications. Merging VSTX files is a common task in document processing, especially when dealing with presentations in Microsoft PowerPoint.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:
- Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other .NET development IDE.
- GroupDocs.Merger for .NET Library: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/merger/net/).
- Sample VSTX Files: Prepare the VSTX files you intend to merge for testing purposes.
- Basic Understanding of C# Programming: Familiarity with C# will be beneficial for implementing the code examples.

## Import Namespaces
Start by importing the necessary namespaces into your C# project:
```csharp
using System; 
using GroupDocs.Merger;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Output Directory
Begin by defining the directory where the merged VSTX file will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Output Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "merged.vstx");
```
Replace `"Your Output Directory"` with the desired path on your system.
## Step 2: Load and Merge VSTX Files
Next, utilize GroupDocs.Merger to load and merge the VSTX files:
```csharp
// Load the source VSTX file
using (var merger = new GroupDocs.Merger.Merger("Your Sample File"))
{
    // Add another VSTX file to merge
    merger.Join("Your Sample File");
    // Merge VSTX files and save result
    merger.Save(outputFile);
}
```
In this snippet:
- `"Your Sample File"` and `"Your Sample File"` represent paths to your source VSTX files. Replace these with your file paths.
## Step 3: Display Merge Completion
Finally, inform the user that the merging process has completed successfully:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nVSTX files merge completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
This line will print the output directory where the merged VSTX file is located.
